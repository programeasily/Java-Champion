/**
 * 1. Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class,
 *    irrespective of how many objects we create.
 * 2. Static variables are created at the start of program execution
 *    and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
 * 3. Initialization of a static variable is not mandatory.
 *    Its default value is 0.
 * 4. If we access a static variable like an instance variable (through an object),
 *    the compiler will show a warning message, which wonâ€™t halt the program.
 *    The compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.
 * 5. If we access a static variable without the class name,
 *    the compiler will automatically append the class name.
